# Lions Gate 2025: Energetic Build-Up Timeline (Aug 2024 – Aug 2025)

**Purpose**: This document chronicles significant energetic, geophysical, solar, atmospheric, and astrological events leading into the Lions Gate Portal on August 8, 2025, culminating in a powerful eclipse. It integrates scientific observations and astrological insights to map the shifting energetic terrain of the planet and its impact on humanity.

## Section 1: Geophysical & Cosmic Energetics

### Stefan Burns Insights

- **Schumann Resonance**: Notable surges in Mode 3 (~20 Hz), signaling an unusual pattern of electromagnetic excitation in Earth's field.
- **Solar Activity**: Frequent solar flares and solar storms have increased ionospheric instability.
- **Cosmic Pulse Hypothesis**: Burns suggests Earth's energy field is reacting to gamma radiation bursts and solar magnetism, potentially influencing brainwave states.
- **Tomsk Data Anomalies**: Intense fluctuations in live resonance charts (notably around early 2025), interpreted as "civil war" among Schumann modes.

## Section 2: Astrological & Consciousness Portals

### Pam Gregory Insights

- **Neptune into Aries (March 2025)**: Marks the first transit since 1861. Symbolizes endings and bold new beginnings on a collective scale.
- **Planetary Alignments**: Pluto, Neptune, and Uranus alignments contributing to rapid soul contract activations and timeline bifurcation.
- **Dream Activation & Intentional Magic**: Emphasis on dreamwork, present-tense manifestations, and rituals during equinoxes and eclipses.
- **Lions Gate Portal**: Described as a Sirius-aligned transmission portal carrying ancient codes and spiritual memory retrieval.
