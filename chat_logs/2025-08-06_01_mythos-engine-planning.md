**Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Session:** 01  
**Participant:** Adge (adriaan-harold-denkers)

## ðŸ“Œ Session Summary
This working session established the foundations for the next iteration of the Mythos Engine (v0.6), centered around the `Myth` node as the symbolic nucleus of a userâ€™s personal mythosphere.

Topics included:
- Component + layer mappings
- Symbolic data container design
- Codex documentation of the `Myth` model
- GitHub integration expansion
- API command extension (including bespoke endpoints)

## ðŸ§µ Myth Node Model (Codified in Codex)
**Codex Path:** `mythos/structure/myth_node_model.md`

```markdown
# ðŸ§µ The Myth Node Model

## Purpose
The `Myth` node serves as the central symbolic container for all content generated by the Mythos Engine. It is the nucleus of a person's mythosphereâ€”housing narratives, symbolic reflections, analytical outputs, and mythic identity structures.

## ðŸ”— Core Relationships
- (:Person) â†’ [:WEAVES] â†’ (:Myth)
- (:Myth) â†’ [:UNFOLDS_THROUGH] â†’ (:Person)
- (:Myth) â†’ [:HAS_ANALYSIS_CONTAINER] â†’ (:MythicAnalysisContainer)
- (:Myth) â†’ [:RECORDS_EXPERIENCE] â†’ (:MythicEntry)
- (:Myth) â†’ [:HAS_SYMBOLISM] â†’ (:SymbolicInsight)

## ðŸ“¦ Containers
### `MythicAnalysisContainer`
- CONTAINS_ANALYSIS â†’ `KeyAnalysis`

### `MythicEntry`
- Timestamped journaling nodes

### `SymbolicInsight`
- Archetypes, motifs, recognized patterns
```

This document was committed and linked to both the `Mythos Engine` component and the personal `Myth` node.

## ðŸ”§ Custom Commands Developed
### `/bespoke` Commands
- `list-github-files`: Lists all tracked files in a GitHub repo
- `read-nginx-config`, `read-sentinel-log`

### `GitHubClient` Extension
```python
def list_files(self, repo, branch="main"):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/git/trees/{branch}?recursive=1"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=self.headers)
    return [item["path"] for item in response.json().get("tree", []) if item["type"] == "blob"]
```

---

## ðŸ”— Graph Changes
- Created `Myth` node linked via:
  - `Person` â†’ `WEAVES` â†’ `Myth`
  - `Myth` â†’ `UNFOLDS_THROUGH` â†’ `Person`
- Linked Codex document to:
  - `Mythos Engine` â†’ `DOCUMENTS_BEHAVIOR_OF` â†’ `CodexDocument`
  - `CodexDocument` â†’ `DEFINES_STRUCTURE_FOR` â†’ `Myth`

---

## ðŸ”® Vision Notes
> The Myth node represents the user's living mythâ€”  
> a symbolic nucleus where their personal narrative, mythic identity, archetypal journey, and reflections converge and evolve.

All outputs of the Mythos Engine will now be connected to this mythic core.
