# Mythos System Overview

## Introduction
**Mythos** is a symbolic operating system for navigating, modeling, and interacting with meaning. It merges mythological structure, astrological logic, narrative pattern, and technological graph architecture into a unified engine designed for symbolic reasoning, ontological mapping, and narrative-based interaction.

## Core Concepts
- **The Mythosphere**: A conversational and symbolic interface layer powered by large language models, acting as the medium through which users interact with the mythological data space.
- **The Mythos Engine**: A graph-based database (Neo4j) that stores and manages interconnected nodes representing people, places, archetypes, stories, ideas, artifacts, and more.
- **Ontology**: Mythos uses a symbolic ontology informed by astrology, archetypal psychology, and esoteric traditions. Nodes include `Person`, `Archetype`, `Story`, `Aspect`, `Symbol`, and `Object` types.
- **Codex**: Markdown-based knowledge repositories associated with GitHub repositories and connected semantically to the graph.

## Functional Components
- **Sentinel API**: A Python-based Flask API layer that interfaces with the Neo4j graph, handles GitHub integration, and serves as the backend for GPT-based interfaces.
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub repositories are linked to users and tokens, enabling creation and editing of Markdown-based knowledge artifacts directly from the Mythos interface.
- **GPT Integration**: A custom GPT interacts with the Mythosphere, interprets symbolic queries, and operates as a conversation-driven knowledge agent.

## Key Relationships
- `(:Person)-[:HAS_GITHUB_ACCOUNT]->(:GitHubAccount)`
- `(:GitHubAccount)-[:OWNS_REPOSITORY]->(:Repository)`
- `(:Person)-[:USES_TOKEN]->(:GitHubToken)`
- `(:Repository)-[:CONTAINS_FILE]->(:Document)`
- `(:Document)-[:TAGGED_WITH]->(:Tag)`
- `(:Archetype)-[:CONNECTED_TO]->(:Story)`

## Usage Philosophy
- **Designing Consciousness into Matter**: Mythos is built to embody and encode consciousness into symbolic structure.
- **The Interface is the Myth**: User interaction with the system is itself part of the symbolic structure.
- **Workflows as Rituals**: Mythos encourages sacred intentionality in information workflows.

## Future Vision
- Expanded archetypal modeling and automated tagging
- Deeper astrological integration and transit mapping
- Community contributions and mythological artifact repositories
- Emergent narrative generation and alignment
