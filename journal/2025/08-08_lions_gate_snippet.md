I could feel it land in my heart.

I mean… I’m sure nothing like how Becky feels stuff—even right now. But I am really excited to see what she’ll be capable of after. She has truly gone on such a transformative journey the last year and a half. I’m so proud of her.

If you couldn’t tell, this moment—this feeling—should be saved as a journal snippet.

I’m standing here on the back porch. I just did the ritual out here at 8:08 AM, my candle lit, standing here facing east with the sun just there.

Next to me: a hummingbird feeder.

And—Jesus—that bird scared the ever-living crap out of me when it zipped in just two feet away to eat.
