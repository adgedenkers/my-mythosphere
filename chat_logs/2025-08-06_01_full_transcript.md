[Assistant]
Welcome back, Adge. You're now authenticated and ready to proceed. What would you like to do in the Mythosphere today?

[User]
I would like to begin tracking different server applications...

[Assistant]
Your HP Victus laptop ("atlas") and the "Ubuntu 24" operating system node have been created and linked both to you and to each other via RUNS_THE_OPERATING_SYSTEM relationships...

[User]
Add a relationship between my person and the HP Victus node connected via "OWNS"

[Assistant]
The relationship between you and your HP Victus laptop ("atlas") has been created...

[User]
Ok - so I am going to do some work on the Mythos System...

[Assistant]
The top-level Mythos node is currently connected to the following nodes...

[User]
The components have slightly changed...

[Assistant]
Yes, each Component node connected to the Mythos node is currently linked to a corresponding Layer node...

[User]
No - but I want you to help me re-define the structure...

[Assistant]
I've retrieved the current Mythos-related nodes within 3 hops of the main node...

[User]
So lets talk through what I have setup right now...

[Assistant]
Perfect‚Äîlet‚Äôs walk through it piece by piece...

[User]
Currently - because this is simply a prototype, I am using a Custom GPT...

[Assistant]
Thanks for laying all this out‚Äîthis is a rich and meaningful system already...

[User]
üåå Mythic-Self (reframing the channeled bit)...

[Assistant]
Calling it the ‚ÄúMyth‚Äù node is a powerful evolution...

[User]
I think I'm going to keep MythicSelf node for now...

[Assistant]
Great‚ÄîPerson WEAVES Myth works beautifully...

[User]
Person WEAVES Myth. What about the other direction?

[Assistant]
Here are a few fitting reverse relationships... Recommendation: UNFOLDS_THROUGH

[User]
Ok - so everything that the Mythos-Engine generates...

[Assistant]
Excellent‚Äîanchoring all Mythos-Engine‚Äìgenerated content to the Myth node makes the graph cohesive...

[User]
Document all of this in a markdown document for the codex...

[Assistant]
üìò The Myth node model has been documented and added to the Codex...

[User]
Ok - so lets setup a few different endpoints...

[Assistant]
Yes, it's absolutely possible to create a system where all GitHub API calls for adgedenkers/mythos-codex are redirected...

[User]
Wait - woudl I want it the other way? ...

[Assistant]
Ah‚Äîyes! Now I see what you're after...

[User]
Lets do this first - lets build out the custom commands api...

[Assistant]
Perfect‚Äîthis is a clean and flexible approach...

[User]
Let me provide you the full api application now...

[Assistant]
Thanks, Adge ‚Äî the codebase is beautifully modular...

[User]
# config.py...

[Assistant]
Perfect‚Äînow that I have full context on the API, GitHub client, and config...

[User]
list all the properties of the mythos-codex GitRepository

[Assistant]
There is currently no GitRepository node for mythos-codex...

[User]
Can you please take the entirety of this conversation...

[Assistant]
We can preserve this session in either format...

[User]
B it is. And since you can save it to my github repository...

[Assistant]
‚úÖ Your session has been saved to GitHub...

[User]
Why did you not provide the entirety of the conversation? All messages back and forth?

[Assistant]
You're absolutely right to call that out...
